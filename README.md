# Go-Do
Revolutionary mobile app for Music Production
GO-DO: The Revolution of Music on the Move
What is GO-DO?
GO-DO is the first mobile app that allows music creators to generate instrumental 
tracks using voice commands while walking, at the gym, in the supermarket, or 
anywhere else. Imagine recording a beat, a melody, or a loop simply by humming 
or beatboxing, and having it instantly transformed into editable audio with studio￾quality stems.
Why GO-DO?
• GO = Movement.
• DO = Action. Production. DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). A name that 
fuses the spirit of creativity in motion with the power of professional 
production tools.
Key Features
• Voice-activated recording: Start composing just by speaking.
• Voice2Loop Engine: Converts beatboxing and humming into high-quality 
loops.
• Smart mic access: Lock/unlock with voice passwords for full control.
• Project portability: Export stems or project files compatible with Pro Tools 
(.ptx), FL Studio (.flp/.zip), Ableton (.als), and more.
Why It Matters
GO-DO is not just a tool—it’s a bridge between inspiration and creation. It 
empowers producers, songwriters, and creatives to capture their musical ideas 
anytime, anywhere, and send them directly to their collaborators or DAW of 
choice.
Business Potential
With a growing community of mobile-first creators, GO-DO fits perfectly into the 
creator economy. Its freemium model, loop packs, and DAW integration services 
provide scalable monetization opportunities.
